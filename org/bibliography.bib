abstract =     {Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and
                  subtle adaptations, often surprising the scientists who
                  discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic
                  process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs,
                  evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many
                  researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed
                  their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their
                  intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code,
                  producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes
                  uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories
                  routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital
                  worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific
                  narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to
                  be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their
                  own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers
                  through oral tradition, but that mode of information
                  transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright
                  loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared
                  only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do
                  not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are
                  and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no
                  collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This
                  paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the
                  fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who
                  have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus
                  serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically
                  important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also
                  present here substantial evidence that the existence and
                  importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the
                  natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all
                  complex evolving systems.},

abstract="L{\'e}vy flights are a class of random walks inspired directly by observing animal foraging habits, in which the stride length is drawn from a power-law distribution. This implies that the vast majority of the strides will be short. However, on rare occasions, the stride are gigantic. We use this technique to self-adapt the mutation rate used in Linear Genetic Programming. We apply this original approach to three different classes of problems: Boolean regression, quadratic polynomial regression, and surface reconstruction. We find that in all cases, our method outperforms the generic, commonly used constant mutation rate of 1 over the size of the genotype. We compare different common values of the power-law exponent to the regular spectrum of constant values used habitually. We conclude that our novel method is a viable alternative to constant mutation rate, especially because it tends to reduce the number of parameters of genetic programing.",

abstract="Geographical distribution is widely held to be a major determinant of evolutionary dynamics. Correspondingly, genetic programming theorists and practitioners have long developed, used, and studied systems in which populations are structured in quasi-geographical ways. Here we show that a remarkably simple version of this idea produces surprisingly dramatic improvements in problem-solving performance on a suite of test problems. The scheme is trivial to implement, in some cases involving little more than the addition of a modulus operation in the population access function, and yet it provides significant benefits on all of our test problems (ten symbolic regression problems and a quantum computing problem). We recommend the broader adoption of this form of ``trivial geography'' in genetic programming systems.",
